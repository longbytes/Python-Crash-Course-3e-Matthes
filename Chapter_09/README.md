# Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with Python

![OOP with Python](OOP%20with%20Python.png)

## Key Concepts: C.O.M.A

### Class

- Class = Blueprint for an object (e.g Car's blueprint).

### Object

- Object = Instance of a Class (e.g. Car).

### Method

- Method = Behaviors of an Object (e.g. Run, start, stop, honk...)

### Attributes

- Attributes = Characteristics of an Object (e.g. Make, model, color, engine size...)

## Other Concepts

### Inheritance

- Creating a new Class using details from an existing Class without modifying it.
- E.g. create an ElectricCar from Car class.

### Encapsulation

- Bundling all Methods & Attributes into one single unit (Class).
- Restricting access from others.

### Polymorphism

- Allows Methods to do different things based on the Object it is acting upon
- E.g. method `move()`:
  - For Car object: `car.move()` = the car runs on the road
  - For Boat object: `boat.move()` = the boat moves on the water surface.
