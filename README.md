# Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Python-Crash-Course-3e-Matthes)

This repo stores my answers to exercises from the book 'Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition' by Eric Matthes.

## How this repo is organized

- The repository follows the book's structure, organizing exercises by chapters and numbers.
- I went through the theory and examples in the book.
- After completing the theory and example section, I tackled the exercises the author calls "Try It Yourself." These are the numbered exercises.
- *A little note*: I've treated this book as both a solid primer and refresher. I kept coming back to chapters and exercises  as needed, which is why you may notice that some are omitted.
