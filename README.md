# Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Python-Crash-Course-3e-Matthes)

This repo stores my answers to the book's exercises or projects (which I found interesting enough - that's why you'll notice some chapters or exercises aren't included).

## How this repo is organized
1
- The repository follows the book structure with the chapters and numbered exercises.
- I went through the theory and examples in the book. I wrote the codes with pens and paper literally. To me, an old-schooler, handwriting is still the best method to learn stuff.
- Then, I entered the codes as Python files in VS Code (I'm a big fan of VS Code).
- After completing the theory and example section, I tackled the exercises the author calls "Try It Yourself." These are the numbered exercises.
