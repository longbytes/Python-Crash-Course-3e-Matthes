# Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Python-Crash-Course-3e-Matthes)

I bought this book from Amazon. An excellent book for Python beginners.

This repo stores my answers to the exercises or projects (that I found interesting enough) mentioned in the book.

## How this repo is organized

- The repository follows the book structure with the chapters and numbered exercises.
- I went through the theory and examples in the book. I wrote the codes with pens and paper literally.
- Then, I tackled the exercises the author calls "Try It Yourself." These are the numbered exercises. 
- I tried my best to solve the exercises on my own. I committed not to use ChatGPT for any of these exercises other than the knowledge gained from the book.
- There's no point in trying to cheat while I'm still learning.
