# Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition by Eric Matthes

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/longnca/Python-Crash-Course-3e-Matthes)

This repo stores my answers to the exercises or projects (that I found interesting enough) mentioned in the book.

## How this repo is organized

- The repository follows the book structure with the chapters and numbered exercises.
- I went through the theory and examples in the book. I wrote the codes with pens and paper literally. To me, an old-schooler, handwriting is still the best method to learn stuff.
- Then, I entered the codes as Python files in VS Code (I'm a big fan of VS Code).
- After completing the theory and example section, I tackled the exercises the author calls "Try It Yourself." These are the numbered exercises.
- I tried my best to solve the exercises on my own. I committed not to use ChatGPT to **solve** any of these exercises other than the knowledge that I learned from the book. There's no point in trying to cheat while I'm still learning.
- But I *did* use ChatGPT as a personal TA (teaching assistant) - it helps explain the terms, tools, and tech tips during the process.
