I bought this book from Amazon. An excellent book for Python beginners.

Please support the author by buying his book at:

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Python-Crash-Course-Eric-Matthes/dp/1718502702)
- [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)

This repo stores my answers to the exercises or projects (that I found interesting enough) mentioned in the book.
